## Getting Started 🏁

Follow the instructions below to get your environment running with the NLP-SQL-engine.

### Prerequisites 📋

- Python 3.x 🐍
- Git 🔧
- A SQL database server (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) 🗄️

### Installation 💻

1. **Clone the repository** 📂
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/SiddharthDaryani/NLP-SQL-engine.git
 cd NLP-SQL-engine
```


2. **Set up the database** 🛢️

- Create a database in your SQL server of choice.
- Use the provided `SQL-script.sql` file to create the necessary tables and insert sample data.

3. **Initialize the environment** ⚙️

Run the setup script to configure your environment and install dependencies.

```bash
source init_setup.sh
```

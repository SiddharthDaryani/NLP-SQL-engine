# NLP-SQL-engine

A Natural Language Processing (NLP) powered SQL query engine that converts natural language text queries into executable SQL statements. This project aims to simplify database querying by allowing users to interact with SQL databases using everyday language.

## Features

- **Natural Language to SQL Translation:** Convert plain English queries into accurate SQL commands.
- **Database Agnostic Setup:** Easily connect to any SQL database by configuring your environment.
- **Quick Setup:** Ready-to-use scripts to initialize your database with sample data.
- **Open Source:** Fully accessible source code for customization and extension.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to get your environment running with the NLP-SQL-engine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Git
- A SQL database server (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SiddharthDaryani/NLP-SQL-engine.git
cd NLP-SQL-engine
```


2. **Set up the database**

- Create a database in your SQL server of choice.
- Use the provided `SQL-script.sql` file to create the necessary tables and insert sample data.

3. **Initialize the environment**

Run the setup script to configure your environment and install dependencies.

source init_setup.sh

## Usage

Once the environment is set up, you can start querying your database using natural language commands. The engine will parse and convert these inputs into SQL and execute them on your configured database.
